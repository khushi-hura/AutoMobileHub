Automobile Hub (AMH) is a native Android app built with Java and SQLite, designed for streamlined car service management. Customers can book mechanic-based services, and service providers receive email updates on service completions, cancellations, or reminders. The app stores data locally and generates detailed PDF reports for service history.
